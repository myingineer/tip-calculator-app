## My process

I tend to style as I am writing my html so it makes my work easier and faster.
I finished the Html and Css designs first before creating a javascript file.
Then I called all my elements from the Html using query selector.
Wrote fixed codes for the fixed percentage buttons.
Wrote code for the custom percentage input field.
Tested everything out.
Then styled the code for mobile designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla css3
- Css float properties and flex property
- Google fonts for the fonts as given in the style guide
- Media query 

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned


I learnt the 'onblur' and 'oninput' event listeners i.e.
input.addEventListener('blur', () => {
  codeeeee
})
I didn't use the 'onblur', but I learnt about it.
